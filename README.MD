# Udacity Full Stack Nanodegree Project: Sports Catalog

# For this project the task is to create a repository to create, edit, deletes sports  and sports items.  This repository will allow a user to create a sport and create sport items for each sport he or she creates.  It will not allow user to edit or delete sports and sports items he or she does not create.
# This repository will allow the user to view sports and sports items in the database that were created by other users.
# This repository is a Python program using the sqlite to connect to the database.

# This repository will require Vagrant to run.  Please download and install Vagrant from https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html
# Data will be obtained from a database named sportscatalog.db
# To load the data, access "http://localhost:8000" or "http://localhost:8000/sports"
# The data displayed is read only unless the user is logged in.

# This project implements a JSON endpoint at "http://localhost:8000/sports/JSON" and "http://localhost:8000//sports/<int:sports_id>/items/JSON"
